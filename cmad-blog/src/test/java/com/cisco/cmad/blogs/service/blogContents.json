Her blog features seasonal vegetarian recipes that are pantry-inspired. Despite ditching Big Macs, Alderson doesn't believe in being obsessive or counting calories (her philosophy is simply to exercise and eat well). Given the results—beautifully photographed whole foods we want to gobble up immediately (curried vegetarian meatballs, we're looking at you!)—it's easy to see why her approach works."

True to its name, Minimalist Baker keeps things simple by sticking to 10 ingredients or less and limiting cook time to 30 minutes tops. Bonus: The recipes are anything but boring! From General Tso's tofu stir fry (pictured) to spicy buffalo chickpea wraps to toasted coconut pancakes, the culinary duo (John and Kate) really know how to pack tons of flavor into simple and oh-so-delicious dishes."

The blog is actually a compilation of recipes, cooking videos, and nutrition tips. Adorable and extremely well-dressed dietitians Wendy Lopez and Jessica Jones appear in every video, teaching home cooks (no matter how strapped for time or inexperienced in the kitchen) that making healthy recipes from scratch is possible."

More than 10 years later, the blog (which we want to live in, it's so gorgeous) focuses on natural, whole foods and Heidi's travels. Naturally it has won multiple awards, been featured in countless publications, and even turned into two bestselling cookbooks. Her latest, Near & Far: Recipes Inspired by Home and Travel, came out in late 2015."

Now she posts recipes that are less extreme, although she is still inspired by her raw food background. Check out this gluten-free plum and blackberry crisp (pictured) or her totally addictive creamy cashew carrot dressing and quinoa bowl. As a certified nutritionist, Hamshaw brings lots of nutritional wisdom to the kitchen. She is also candid about being in recovery from anorexia and orthorexia and uses her site to encourage others to heal their broken relationship with food (often through plant-based diets)."

Best of all, the author's healthy-eating philosophy is an open door: There's no right or wrong way to eat healthy...

But her creations also had to appeal to her husband, who, at the time, was a devout fast-food lover that drank pop like water. Her efforts—recipes like smoky butternut squash sauce with pasta and greens; vegan Caesar salad; and sun-dried tomato, mushroom, and spinach tofu quiche—not only swayed her sig O, but a massive following of readers."

After its first government resigned, there was a sense of distrust about the reasons for the resignation, and the other parties jumped on that one. However, the second election in Delhi after that (which should have been a cakealk for the BJP given its immense wins in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi and nationally) was an election in which the AAP won an immense victory (winning more than 50% of the vote and winning 67 of the seats up for grabs is an immense victory). However, soon after the second innings of the AAP in Delhi, there was an immense shock. The party had 3 main people at the helm – Arvind Kejriwal, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. Soon, there was news that there was an internal battle going on within the party and that there was not likely to be a reconciliation and resettlement. And so both Yadav and Bhushan were kicked out of the party (along with a couple others) and incidentally also losing the support of 2 out of the 4 MP’s that the party had from Punjab. This was a factor that provided a continuing ground for resentment at the treatment of the duo, and talk of a coterie around Kejriwal and leader kind of culture."

As of now, even more than 2 years into the term of Narendra Modi and the BJP, people are satisfied with their performance; not enthusiastic, not ecstatic, but satisified. And the BJP would be fine with the electorate remaining satisfied. In the next elections to the country in 2019, they need people to feel that the Government worked and tried to make their lives better; even if they are not able to see a major change in their lives, as long as they feel that the people at the top are not corrupt, are trying hard and seemingly devoted to the job of Government, they will vote for the Government in enough numbers that the BJP will retain its Government (after all, it itself got only 31% of the vote, but that is more than adequate to defeat its rivals convincingly and especially when the Congress still remains down in the dumps).

                "content":"For some months now, there have been reports and videos of cow vigilatism coming in from the Hindi heartland, on the borders of Delhi and Haryana, and other places in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It was quite clear that these vigilantes were not an insignificant number, and it was equally clear that what they were doing was outside the scope of the law. No law gives the right to intercept vehicles or other people unless you are a law enforcer (police or similar agency). The police should be the first one to object to any private citizens taking the law into their own hands, but in this case, the police did not take any action. Now, it is not an unfair proposition that this was because of political influences, and it is only the BJP (and the parent organization, the RSS) which is encouraging this tactic, of promoting the cow as a symbol of Hindu and national pride, the mother animal for the entire country. This came dramatically to the forefront during the attack in Dadri, where mere suspicion of the consumption of cow meat caused the death of a Muslim man. This attack horrified large sections of the country, but the local BJP leaders were not at all defensive. They rose to the defense of those people charged with the death, and there were politicians from to place who claimed that the cow was the holy mother, and anybody taking action against the cow would be threatened."
